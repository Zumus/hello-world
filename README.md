# hello-world

Hi all! This is my first repository on GitHub.

I'm an Applied Mathematics major at UCLA with a Specialization in Computing, I've been interested in computer science since I was 13, and I'm shocked that it's taken me this long to create my own GitHub repository after using this tool for so long.

Happy coding!
